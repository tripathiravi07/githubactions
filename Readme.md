# GitHub Actions Sample Project (Python)

This repository demonstrates how to use GitHub Actions for CI/CD automation in a Python project.

## Features
- Automated build and test workflows
- Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline
- Deployment automation
- Scheduled and manual workflow runs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A GitHub repository
- Basic understanding of YAML
- GitHub Actions enabled for your repository
- Python installed (recommended version: 3.8+)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/github-actions-sample.git
   cd github-actions-sample
   ```
2. Navigate to `.github/workflows/` to view the workflow YAML files.
3. Modify the workflows as per your project requirements.

## Example Workflow
Below is an example of a simple CI workflow for a Python project:

```
name: Python CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v3
        with:
          python-version: '3.8'
      
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      
      - name: Run Tests
        run: src/pytest
```

## Running Workflows
- Workflows automatically trigger on `push` and `pull_request` events.
- You can manually trigger workflows from the GitHub Actions tab.
